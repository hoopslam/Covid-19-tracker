# About Covid-19 Tracker 🚀

A Covid-19 global tracker to visually see the spread and distribution of covid-19.  This was my first big React project and it helped me to really understand the core principles of React a lot better.  This was built in the mist of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic and I wanted to build something in React that could visually show the data that was available from the disease.sh API.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

To build this app, I used the following technologies:

-   React
-   React Leaflet (For the interactive map)
-   chart.js (For the pie charts)
-   CSS
-   disease.sh open API

## 📝 Features

-   Data fetched from the disease.sh API.
-   Search by country functionality
-   Interactive map that visualizes the selected data
-   A filtered list with a graph representation of the data

## What I Learned from this project

-   The core principles of React like State composition, useEffect, and how React handles rendering vs painting directly on the DOM vs using the Virtual DOM
-   How to leverage Leaflet to integrate a fully interactive map into my projects
-   How to build charts with chart.js as well as with plain CSS
-   How to share data from different components throughout the application.  There was a lot of thought that went into how to compose the overall project architecture.
